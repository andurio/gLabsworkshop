INIT
git init is used to create a repository

STATUS
git status tells me the state of my working directory

git doesnt automatically keep track of stuff unless you tell it to

ADD
git add tells git to track specific files or folders

Ignoring Things GITIGNORE
crated another file in ST3 called '.gitignore'. in that file I type the name of the file or directory that i want git to ignore

ADD EVERYTHING
git add .
^ that adds everything in the depository

Git doesnt automatically save the changes that we work on, it must be told to do so

COMMIT
git commit -m “add note text here”

PUSH
alright, so fas so good. now time to PUSH my first commits up to Github aka connect local repo to GitHub repo….
 in terminal:  git remote add origin https://github.com/andurio/glabsworkshop.git

to check that the remote origin has been set up correctly terminal: git remove -v

listing is twice for Push and Fetch

Time to finally make first PUSH…
git push

How Commits Work - 3 box model
1. repository - where git actually stores stuff internally
2. staging area - imaginary place that git uses what we’re going to commit
3. working directory - folder on desktop where files are
    1. notes.txt

Simplified way to commit to online repo:
1. git add <file> or git add . (to add all)
2. git commit -m 

COMMIT EARLY, COMMIT OFTEN - commit after every meaningful change
AND WRITE USEFUL -M/COMMIT MESSAGES

commit messages/guidelines
-write in the present “change”
-write “what this will do”

COMMIT LOGS
git log shows us all commits that were made

QUICK COMMIT MESSAGES
git log --oneline shows summary of all commits
